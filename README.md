# Afalos Emergence - The emergence of Afalos

Your last time to get involved!

Multiplayer game inspired by the SAO style of play, the same map with enough space for each player to have terrain, with all kinds of spaces, that the players choose if they will be merchants, adventurers, or any other type of character, a world in the fact that there is a king, a hierarchical system integrated and elaborated by the players themselves, special prizes, without prefabricated characters, that the user creates their own totally personalized avatar.

The game will be set with medieval features in terms of the visualization of the environment and the weapons used, everything will be based on clearly human abilities although the forces that operate are evil and divine around the characters but users will not be able to use magic or similar things , unless they choose to be part of a given religion and in that case you must keep your faith.

The game will lack a goal, it will be a logical endless game, the user ends the game when they feel satisfied with their progress, and above all it must provide the possibility of organizing special events and providing the opportunity to explore the entire world without compromise and enjoy it.

The player will inevitably have to survive and develop just as he does in his real life, only his avatar will need his owner less often than his real body.

I have not made up my mind with the platform yet but I lean towards web technology because it is multiplatform without further complications and would use technologies that I already know, I would have to study little compared to the other options.

Another option would be to develop a client for each platform, but it would take longer to deliver what I want to the user.

There will be different cities, among which there will be one of high technology, one of occult arts, one of mythical creatures, the others I will gradually add.
